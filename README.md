### Hello

My name's Abdulrahman

I have experience in production natural language processing systems for
the pharmaceutical and financial domains, search, information retrieval and reranking
systems, retrieval augmented generation, multimodal generative AI, AI autonomous
agents, conversational AI.
- I'm particularly interested in research, academia and educating
- I can do MLOps
- I can use PyTorch, JAX, Tensorflow, FastAPI, Docker and CUDA
- I can quantize, compress and optimize models for deployment
- I can resist the urge to use emojis in my profile README
- I'm the guy who brings out a laptop with Ubuntu on it to show you I can run a 7B model on my i3 with no GPU (god help us all)
